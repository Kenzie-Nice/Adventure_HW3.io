        <p id="story-text">A long time ago, nations could not find equal grounds; peace was nothing but a dream for the hopeful. The world as you knew it is long gone. Nuclear war has turned the once lush and lively land into a wasteland. You wake up in the ruins of an old bunker.
            You have lived here for some time now, in an uninhabited place, and so far, it's safe. It's early morning, and the sun peeks through your makeshift curtains over the windows. It is warm and muggyâ€”a typical day. 
            What do you do?</p>
        <button onclick="choosePath('explore')">Explore the outside</button>

                    you think it might be a good day to brave the wilds and search for more items. Just in case. ";
