I rewrote the code, being unaware that this assignment hasn't been officially graded yet.....Sorry )

Using AI for this assignment was both helpful and a learning experience. It streamlined a lot of the setup, helping me structure my functions and logic more efficiently. However, I still had to troubleshoot, adjust, and debug issues along the way. Just because the AI-generated code doesn’t mean it was perfect—I had to figure out why certain things weren’t working and make necessary fixes.  

It also made me think about how AI is becoming more integrated into modern workflows. Many companies already use AI to enhance productivity, so it doesn’t seem unreasonable for students to use it to assist with assignments. The challenge is making sure I still understand what’s happening in the code and not just relying on AI to do all the work for me. Ultimately, it was a tool that sped things up, but I still had to think critically and make adjustments to get everything working the way I wanted.

The most significant success i had in this was ensuring my photos were uploaded and displayed correctly. As they are part of my challenge in which I didn't realize it...but i had accidentally placed the src.jpg into the choice statements, making the structure wrong. And i am ashamed to say...it took me quite a few minutes to realize what I had done. haha 
When I finally realized the error, I had to redo the images to make sure they were ALL in the proper spot and displayed correctly on the page. Part of what occurred was that it couldn't read correctly either, which made the "wait" option no longer function properly. 
The only other issue was that I used a pre-saved name for the CSS (pre-saved from past projects) that automatically labeled the sheet as Styles.css (with an s), but I wrote it in as style.css. So, background designs did not appear properly until I also fixed that. 
all in all the outcome could have been worse. 


AI Creation: It was quite unique when I asked Chatgpt to recreate the assignment. It not only gave its own story and options but went out of its way to create the background and everything as desired. But it was far deeper and seemingly more advanced. namely, it made more options available to follow through with more paths as well. I have never cared for how easily it seems to create its own story up so quickly. It just seems so off-putting. I like using it to help find errors in my work, but how can it so quickly adapt anything to do what it wants? it's creepy.  It makes one wonder what has truly been made by human and what is merely an AI algorithm built in mere seconds.
