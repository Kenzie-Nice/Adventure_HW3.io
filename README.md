i think the biggest success i had in this was making sure my photos were getting uploaded and displayed properly. As they are part of my challenge in which i didnt realize it...but i had accidently placed the src.jpg into the choice statements, making the structure wrong. And i am ashamed to say...it took me quite a few minutes to realize what I had done. haha 
When i finally realized the error i then had to redo the images to make sure they were ALL in the proper spot but also were displaying correctly on the page. As part of what occured was that it couldnt not read correctly either, which made the "wait" option no longer fuction properly. 
The only other issue, was that I used a pre-saved name for the CSS. (pre-saved from past projects) that automatically labeled the sheet as Styles.css (with an s) but i wrote it in as style.css....so background designs were not appearing properly until i also fixed that. 
all in all the outcome could have been worse. 


AI Creation: When I asked Chatgpt to recreate the assigment, it was quite....unqiue? It not only gave its own story and options but went out of its way to create the background and everything as desired. But far deeper and seemingly more advanced. namely it made more options avalible to follow through with more paths as well.
